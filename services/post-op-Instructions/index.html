                <p>It is important to follow instructions after you have oral surgery to ensure proper healing and
                    to avoid complications. As a rule of thumb, you should always wait two hours after surgery
                    before eating to let the anesthesia wear off. Trying to eat before this could result in soft
                    tissue damage because you are not able to feel all of your mouth. The instructions found below
                    are guidelines. After your surgery the doctor or dental assistant will give you full
                    instructions on how to properly recover from surgery.</p>
                <p><strong>Root Canal Therapy</strong></p>
                <p>You can expect soreness after a root canal procedure for a few days. You should avoid chewing on
                    the side of your mouth where the procedure was performed so you do not irritate the area and
                    also to ensure that the temporary restorative material properly sets. You will also need to take
                    an antibiotic to treat any remaining infection in your tooth. If you notice an increasing amount
                    of pain or tenderness, a reaction to the medication, or the loss of the temporary restoration
                    (filling) call your dentist immediately.</p>
                <p><strong>Crowns and Bridges</strong></p>
                <p>Before you receive your permanent crown/bridge you will first receive a temporary restoration.
                    This is not as sturdy as the permanent version, so you should be careful when cleaning and
                    eating. You should brush the area gently and should not pull up on the tooth when flossing
                    because it could become dislodged. The same goes for eating. You should avoid sticky or chewy
                    foods while you have the temporary in.</p>
                <p>There may be some sensitivity and irritation after the temporary or permanent is placed. This is
                    normal and will subside after the soft tissue heals. A warm salt water rinse will help, and you
                    can also take Advil or Tylenol if the pain does not go away.</p>
                <p>When the permanent crown or bridge is placed it may feel a little awkward for a few days. Your
                    mouth needs to adjust to the new tooth, and it should feel like one of your natural tooth in
                    less than a week. If your bite feels abnormal in any way, you should let your dentist know.
                    Caring for your bridge or crown is just like caring for your own teeth. You should brush and
                    floss regularly.</p>
                <p><strong>White Fillings (Bonding)</strong></p>
                <p>After the anesthesia wears off your teeth will likely be sensitive. You should avoid hot and cold
                    food or drink for the next few days. After that initial period, your treated teeth will feel as
                    good as new. Continue your normal hygiene plan to ensure that your fillings last for a long
                    time.</p>
                <p><strong>Scaling and Root Planing</strong></p>
                <p>After this procedure your gums will probably be slightly sore and irritated for a few days. You
                    should rinse your mouth with warm salt water (1 tsp salt/8 oz water) 2-3 times a day. This will
                    relieve the pain and cleanse the area. Brushing and flossing should be continued right after the
                    procedure, but you should brush gently so that you do not further irritate the area. If you
                    experience any swelling or stiffness in the area you can place a cold compress on the area and
                    take some pain relieving medicine. Avoid any hard or chewy foods for 2-3 days after the surgery
                    to ensure the area heals correctly. If you continue to experience pain or swelling after a few
                    days contact your dentist.</p>
                <p><strong>Veneers</strong></p>
                <p>Before you receive your permanent veneer you will first receive a temporary restoration. This is
                    not as sturdy as the permanent version, so you should be careful when cleaning and eating. You
                    should brush the area gently and should not pull up on the tooth when flossing because it could
                    become dislodged. The same goes for eating. You should avoid sticky or chewy foods while you
                    have the temporary in.</p>
                <p>There may be some sensitivity and irritation after the temporary or permanent is placed. This is
                    normal and will subside after the soft tissue heals. A warm salt water rinse will help, and you
                    can also take Advil or Tylenol if the pain does not go away.</p>
                <p>When the veneer is placed it may feel a little awkward for a few days. Your mouth needs to adjust
                    to the new tooth, and it should feel like one of your natural tooth in less than a week. If your
                    bite feels abnormal in any way, you should let your dentist know. When brushing and flossing you
                    should pay close attention to the area between the veneer and the tooth at the gum line.</p>
                <p><strong>Extractions</strong></p>
                <p>After the surgery you will need to rest. You need to be driven home by a friend or family member
                    because of the anesthesia. You can expect for the extraction site to bleed for a little while
                    after the surgery. Gauze will be applied at the completion of the surgery, and you will need to
                    change it when it becomes soaked. If bleeding continues for longer than 24 hours you should call
                    your dentist. Rest when you return home, but do not lie flat. This could prolong the bleeding.
                    Prop your head up on a pillow when lying down. Your dentist will prescribe you pain medication,
                    so if you become sore take as directed. You can also use an ice pack for the pain. Your dentist
                    might also provide you with a cleaning solution to clean the extraction site.</p>
                <p><strong>You will be limited to soft foods for a few days after your surgery. Some recommended
                        foods are:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gelatin</li>
                    <li>Pudding</li>
                    <li>Yogurt</li>
                    <li>Mashed Potatoes</li>
                    <li>Ice Cream</li>
                    <li>Thin Soups</li>
                    <li>...and other food you can eat without chewing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>When drinking, make sure you do not use a straw. The sucking motion can loosen your
                        sutures and slow the clotting process. The same goes for smoking. If you have prolonged
                        pain, bleeding, irritation, or don't feel that the extraction site is healing properly call
                        your dentist for a follow up.</strong></p>
